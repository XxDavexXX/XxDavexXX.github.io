      <p>The purpose of this website is to be able to help our dear web visitors to choose the best cpu for their needs, informing the cores it should have, the number of threads, its clock frequency, cache memory, power consumption, etc. processor etc In summary, the fundamental characteristics to choose a good processor, be it for work, studies, games or another art of the kind. On the other hand, I plan to include a photo gallery so that you can see the images of the cpu and its respective parts with detailed information under the image and especially the prestige of the brand.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        As we all know, one of the fundamental pieces in our PCs are the CPUs, and a good choice of them will largely determine the rest of the elements that make up the computer and therefore its power and performance when playing different video games. work or studies. <br>
        <br> Since CPUs for gamers are divided into CPUs with 6, 8, 10 or more cores, we are going to analyze each and every one of them by part. In other words, the main criterion will be the number of cores that these CPUs will have, where we have established a floor at 6 cores, since the lower ones will become obsolete very soon as the market progresses, and we consider that this is what is It best suits the vast majority of users in terms of quality-price and performance.

      <h3>Fundamental Information</h3>
      <p>
        If you are going to upgrade your PC or buy a new computer, the processor is one of the components that requires more attention. The investment is important and therefore it is essential to know the specifications of each model in order to choose the best processor for our equipment. <br> <br>
        The details and characteristics around a processor go far beyond the manufacturer, the cores or the operating frequency. Knowing what each figure and associated technology means is key so that, within the investment we want to make, we can get the most out of it and not end up with a team that we don't take full advantage of, or worse, that doesn't offer us the ability to process we need to play, work or our day-to-day leisure. <br> <br>
        The two main and most referenced data when we talk about a processor are the cores and the frequency. The combination of both elements and their individual figures mark us globally what the performance of this component of our PC will be.

        When it comes to technology, the common consumer can be dazzled by so many bombastic names and numbers of devices that, probably, will never be used to the fullest of their capacities. Therefore, it is essential to be clear about both our specific needs and specific priorities when buying a new processor. Likewise, we must assume the possibility that, when acquiring it, we may have to add a new graphics card, a ventilation system or an additional memory card that allows to balance the entire computer system as a whole. Next, our comparison, on two important brands: AMD and INTEL. <br> <br> AMD Ryzen 7 5800X This amazing processor is close to resembling the human brain. It has a Zen 3 architecture in 7nm, in addition to 8 cores and 16 threads, at 3.8 GHz-4.7 GHz. It has no less than 32 MB of L3 cache and a TDP of 105 watts.

        It supports overclocking (increasing the clock speed of electronic components) and has an AM4 socket (B450 chipset or higher).
        
        For all its properties, this device is one of the high-end processors for big budgets. <br> <br>
        Intel Core i7-10700 Some opinions indicate that this processor can be classified as mid-high range, at an affordable price. Its architecture is Comet Lake-S in the 14 nm++ process.

It has 8 cores and 16 threads at 2.9 GHz-4.8 GHz, normal and turbo mode. It also has 16 MB of L3 cache. Its TDP is 65 watts and includes a fan.

It supports demanding professional applications, but not overclocking. Its socket is LGA1200 (400 chipset). <br> <br> Intel Core i3-10100F Many opinions point out that this type of processor is definitely the most reasonable for your pocket. It has a Comet Lake-S architecture in the process of 14 nm++.

In addition, it has 4 cores and 8 threads at 3.6 GHz-4.3 GHz, normal and turbo mode. It has 6 MB of L3 cache and a TDP of 65 watts, with fan included. Its socket is 1200 (chipset 400).

It does not support overclocking, but it responds quite well to the use of applications that do not require as many threads. Its synergy with high-end graphics cards is not smooth, so it is not recommended to combine it with them.
